Read the paper on Gibbs sampling, implement it using a software package such as PyMC, Stan, PyStan. Note that Gibbs sampling itself doesn't cooperate with some of these packages for this particular scenario. Use any sampling method available to do the inference.

Stretch goal 5 points: Implement Gibbs sampling by hand as shown in the paper
